                    I'm Rupesh Prajapat, a Senior Salesforce Developer with over
                    4 years of experience designing and developing robust
                    solutions on the Salesforce platform. I specialize in
                    Lightning Web Components (LWC), Apex, and building
                    high-performance UIs using Bryntum Grid and Scheduler. My
                    work focuses on creating user-friendly interfaces and
                    scalable backend logic aligned with business needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently at Metacube, I contribute to the development of
                    the Professional Services Automation (PSA) product by
                    Certinia (formerly FinancialForce). Iâ€™ve taken on key
                    responsibilities like managing release cycles, mentoring
                    team members, and solving complex technical challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm certified in Salesforce PD1, PD2, and JD1, and have
                    hands-on experience with tools like VS Code, Git, Jenkins,
                    and JIRA. My journey started with core programming in C++
                    and evolved into building enterprise-grade Salesforce
                    applications, including internal tools like a Permission
                    Visualizer App.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, I enjoy mentoring new developers, staying
                    up-to-date with emerging technologies, and contributing to
                    team growth.
